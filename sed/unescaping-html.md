## Unescaping HTML Entities using sed

To unescape HTML entities, you can use the `sed` command with regular expressions. The `sed` command can search and replace patterns in text, making it suitable for handling HTML entities.
```bash
sed 's/\&apos\;/\x27/g;s/\&quot\;/"/g;s/\&gt\;/>/g;s/\&lt\;/</g;s/\&amp\;/\&/g'
```
**Note:** Be cautious when processing HTML using regular expressions, as it might not handle all possible edge cases and complexities of HTML parsing.
