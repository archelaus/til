## Removing duplicate lines with awk
To remove duplicate lines from a text file using AWK, you can use the following command:
```
awk '!seen[$0]++' input_file > output_file
```
**Explanation:**
- `awk`: Command to invoke AWK, a powerful text processing tool.
- `!seen[$0]++`: This is the AWK script that does the magic. It uses an associative array seen to keep track of the lines encountered. $0 represents the entire line. When a line is first encountered, `!seen[$0]++` evaluates to true, and AWK prints the line. For subsequent occurrences of the same line, `seen[$0]++` becomes non-zero, and the expression evaluates to false, so the line is not printed.

**Why awk over sort or uniq?**
  Because it's faster, albeit a bit unintuitive.
