## Unescaping HTML Entities with Perl

In Perl, you can use the `HTML::Entities` module to unescape HTML entities easily. This module provides functions to encode and decode HTML entities, making it a reliable and efficient solution.
```bash
perl -MHTML::Entities -pe '$_ = decode_entities($_)' input_file.html
```
This one-liner will read the content of the HTML file, unescape the HTML entities, and print the unescaped content to the terminal.
